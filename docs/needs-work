This is numbered items that needs work or research.

1 - How to deal with materials

	We need to better define how we want to deal with materials and materials templates in the project.

2 - How to deal with collections and their indices

	When we want to refer to an entry in a collection and we may also remove entries from that collection it may become tricky in the case each item does not have a uique identifier.
	We should figure out the requirements for this and implement a UUID manager for dealing with this issue. The uuid module has nice random UUIDs one could make use of.

3 - Specification for data validation

	Decide how we should validate data and how the API for it should look.
	Do we want to run data through a function that gives us an internal structure that gives us all the data and if it is proper or not or do we just want to get a yes/no?
