1	Setting up baking

	For baking we have two options
		render.bake.use_clear
			Will clear target atlas before baking - this should probably never be set

		render.bake.margin
			Margin when baking in texels - this needs to be set according to our wishes

	Other options
		cycles.bake_type = 'DIFFUSE'
		render.bake.use_pass_direct = False
		render.bake.use_pass_indirect = False
		render.bake.use_pass_color = True


2	UV operations

	This is an excerpt from blender/source/blender/editors/uvedit/uvedit_unwrap_ops.c

		Object **objects = BKE_view_layer_array_from_objects_in_edit_mode_unique_data_with_uvs

	This means we probably need to make sure we are in the proper context rather than attempting context override

3	UV Layer

	When we are performing packing or other operations on the UV layer it is important that the correct layer is active.

4	Index from name

	 bpy_prop_collection defines a find method for getting the numerical ID

5	Data relationships

	Currently a workmesh does not have a property for looking up the variant and bake target it comes from.
	Now we will iterate through all the variants to map these but later on we may want to deal with this better.
	It also hinges a bit on how we want to deal with our bake targets, if we should make the meshes be the bearer of the data instead of a separate collection.
