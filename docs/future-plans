Future plans

	1 - Rethink baketarget/variant to be less complex

		We currently want to get to a working plugin that the artists can use but after that milestone (M1) is reached

	2 - Log important data for trouble shooting reasons.

		By important data we could have things like: selected objects, running operator and such
