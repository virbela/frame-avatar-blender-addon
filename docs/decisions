Brief
	This document is intended to be a place where decisions are logged and explained.

Rationale
	Without logging the reasons for certain decisions that were made to perhaps fix a bug or work around an issue develoers are bound to repeat old mistakes.
	This is costly of time and effort and to document such decisions is a good way to prevent it.

	Baking - overview of process

		Currently we create a new scene for baking where the intention was to separate out baking to make it easier to differentiate from the remaining of the blend file.
		The drawback here is that the properties in HomeomorphicProperties are defined on a per scene basis so when we select the bake scene all the bake target disappear.

		More information:

			https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/153000/blender-dev-global-location-to-store-project-properties

		Current workaround:

			We fetch properties from the work scene¹ always.

		Notes
			¹	The work scene is defined by name and is currently defined in the module 'constants' as the variable 'WORK_SCENE'.




	Logging system

		Currently we use a context manager to keep track of the context but after using that, it didn't really make things easier.
		We will instead have a single instance where we pass the blender context as the first argument.
		The reason we want the context in the first place is to be able to access the addon preferences.
