	Since the bake targets should now reference items in the bake scene some changes have to be done to the panel
	We haven't made anything for the bake groups which is an important step in the workflow so addressing that

	Hit a snag, see Todo-4

		Notes about this situation

			If we have a reference to an object in blender and that object is removed that object will raise a referenceerror when deferring it.
			We can make a function to test for this, is_reference_valid in helpers.py


			Save hooks

		Dropping this for now, we will use names indices for now for referencing things and fix this later.


	I still have trouble referencing things, now I want to reference the bake target used as base for a mirror.
		I am currently investigating if I could somehow use prop_search but get a custom property back, like the index of an item (or later UUID).

	I figured out how we can point to objects in the correct way like so: https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/99965

		This will take at least one head ache out, next step is to figure out how to point to our own bake target (with the mirror function).



	Since mirrors should use the same UV map, we need to synchronize work meshes. We need a button for doing this. We will call it synchronize mirrors.
	It could have a warning about what changes will be made.
		It should create or recreate a specific UV map on the mirrored workmesh


	Going to skip mirrors for now in order to make sure the entirety of the workflow works

	I am noticing that blender will know the index of things in lists because of output such as bake_target=bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].homeomorphictools.bake_target_collection[0])
	This could come in handy in solving the index/reference issue
