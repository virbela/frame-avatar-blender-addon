		Bake targets (ui.panels.FRAME_PT_batch_bake_targets)

			Bake target list
				Type:			FRAME_UL_bake_targets
				Item type:		properties.BakeTarget
				Description:	List of bake targets from HT.bake_target_collection where HT.selected_bake_target is the selected item

			If there is a selected bake target (et):
				MAYBE-TODO: Rename et to make more sense

				Search box for object in scene.objects → et.object_name

				If there is such object et.object_name:
					Search box for shape_keys in the object et.object_name → et.shape_key_name

				Scalar for UV area weight (importance factor) → et.uv_area_weight
				Cardinal for number of variants this bake has → et.variant_count
				Option for UV island mode (see documentation on properties.BakeTarget) → et.uv_mode


			Bake target mirror entry list (see documentation (#TODO: write) for details regarding how UV island mirroring works)
				Type:			FRAME_UL_bake_target_mirrors
				Item type:		properties.BakeTargetMirrorEntry
				Description:	List of bake targets that should be handled as mirrored targets


			Operator to create bake targets from shape key names
				Calls:			baking.create_bake_targets_from_shapekeys
