#TODO - make this document about the workflow and move out things to the proper documents

workflow

	update baking scene

		We create meshes that we use for baking
		We put these meshes in a specific scene for baking
		We name them according to a specific pattern - we need to be able to get this name also when making sure we are not creating double meshes
		We assign materials to these meshes

	clean up normals for baking

		#TBD - selection based? always do all of them? one button for all, one for selected?

		We clean up normals using average face area



bake targets

	A bake target can be part of a bake group. If this is the case, the objects will be baked together.
	The object used for baking should have a particular bake material and we can create this with materials.setup_bake_material2
