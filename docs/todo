These todo notes have numbers that are referenced in the source code as "todo note N".
The purpose of this is to allow for more elaborate descriptions that are needed in multiple places.

Non numbered items

    * We should make sure no dots are in names since we use dots as separators for ROOT_OBJECT.SHAPE_KEY.VARIANT or ROOT_OBJECT.VARIANT if no shape keys are there

    * We should have convenience functions for manipulating collections based on name

        set_active(bto.data.shape_keys.key_blocks, bto.data.shape_keys.key_blocks[bake_target.shape_key_name])
          â†“
        set_active_name(bto.data.shape_keys.key_blocks, bake_target.shape_key_name)

    * maybe have buttons for selecting all UV islands of color or gray

   	* make sure we select proper UV maps when baking

   		Now this is set up when packing but it is easy to change it by mistake by clicking in the UV layer list of the object.

   	* have a look at https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.app.handlers.html


Numbered items

1	Iterate through valid bake targets

	If a bake target is mirrored and also is the secondary part of a mirror we should skip it in this iteration.
	This happens in multiple places and a generalized form should be made instead.

	Example of current typical implementation
	-----------------------------------------

		for bt in ht.bake_target_collection:
			mirror, mt = bt.get_mirror_type(ht)
			if mt is MIRROR_TYPE.SECONDARY:
				continue
