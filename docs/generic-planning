    1) Complete bake target channels implementation starting with adding the variants.
    2) Implement and test Paint Assist within the FABA.

    a) Clicking paint button :

    i) the selected morph will be focussed upon in 3d viewport on the right in paint mode.
    ii) the paint color should be set to blue if the Color option is selected.
    iii) the paint color should be set to gray if the Greyscale option is selected.
    iv) materials will be applied to bake target meshes enabling the AO to be visible while painting.
    v) the 1k paint texture should be shown on the left.
    vi) show text log on the bottom revealing standard out feedback to artist.

    b) If another morph is selected while in paint mode:

    i) save the 1k paint texture the of the previous morph being painted.
    ii) do the same things shown above.

    3) Use the FABA start to finish. Paint the eyes as projected from view. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1To1TqYmnm3_Hc3WubbNneVOWB1WNvyIH
    4) On export, implement the compositing to the final 4k atlas including all the greyscale layers and color layer.
    Implement Frame application GES and SSF chunking adjustments to accommodate for the new layered atlas approach.
    5) Push changes to FABA and Frame branches.  Use #frame-deployment channel /loadbranch hook to deploy your Frame branch to our test server.
    6) Post an update in our shared discusion with a link to the test server : port running your branch.
